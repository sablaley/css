                    <h4>Web Development </h4>
                    <p> Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site
                        for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). This can
                        include web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side
                        scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
                        development. However, among web professionals, "web development" usually
                        refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and
                        coding. Web development can range from developing the simplest static single
                        page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic
                        businesses, or social network services.

                    <h4>Web development as an industry</h4>
                    <p> Since the mid-1990s, web development has been one of the fastest growing
                        industries in the world. In 1995 there were fewer than 1,000 web development
                        companies in the United States, but by 2005 there were over 30,000 such
                        companies[citation needed] in the U.S. alone. The growth of this industry is being
                        pushed by large businesses wishing to sell products and services to their customers
                        and to automate business workflow</p>

                    <h4>Security Considerations</h4>
                    <p>Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data
                        entry error checking through forms, filtering output, and encryption.[1] Malicious
                        practices such as SQL injection can be executed by users with ill intent yet with only
                        primitive knowledge of web development as a whole. Scripts can be exploited to
                        grant unauthorized access to malicious users trying to collect information such as
                        email addresses, passwords and protected content like credit card numbers.</p>
